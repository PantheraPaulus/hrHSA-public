# Case Studies

## Static RSF (Pangolin)

### Challenge

Ground pangolins are among the most cryptic large mammals on Earth. As a consequence, surprisingly little is known about their habitat requirements, life history, or behavioural ecology. The few available telemetry studies are necessarily based on small sample sizes and geographically restricted populations, making it unclear whether their conclusions can be generalized across the species' vast distribution.

This uncertainty is of direct conservation relevance. Throughout much of their range, ground pangolins are threatened by intense poaching pressure and are likely to persist at viable densities only within well-managed reserves and sanctuaries. Identifying suitable areas for future protection therefore requires an accurate understanding of habitat selection. Failing to identify essential habitat features may render newly established reserves unsuitable; failing to account for individual variation may underestimate the ecological niche available to the species as a whole; and failing to quantify uncertainty risks overinterpreting stochastic patterns arising from telemetry error or remotely sensed environmental predictors.

Based on extensive field observations, we hypothesize that ground pangolins preferentially select habitat edges between dense bush and open grassland. Such ecotones may provide a favourable combination of prey abundance (ants and termites), suitable burrow locations, and immediate refuge from predators or disturbance. Indeed, disturbed pangolins are frequently observed retreating from open foraging areas into adjacent bush. If this hypothesis is correct, both heavily bush-encroached areas and recently cleared landscapes should represent comparatively poor habitat.

Testing this hypothesis requires translating the qualitative concept of an edge into quantitative environmental predictors suitable for a Resource Selection Function.

We analyse telemetry data from 26 ground pangolins collected between July 2024 and April 2026, comprising an average of 1,022 relocations per individual (range 589–2,008). The collars employ an above-ground detection algorithm (Kasko et al., in prep.), recording locations only while the animal is active outside its burrow. This results in approximately 5–6 relocations per day, corresponding closely to the average nightly activity period.

To quantify vegetation structure, we derived habitat metrics from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Edges were detected as abrupt spatial changes in the ratio between vertically and horizontally polarized backscatter. From these edge maps we calculated two predictors that we hypothesize to be ecologically meaningful for pangolins: distance to the nearest edge and edge density at multiple spatial scales. To illustrate Bayesian regularization and variable selection, we additionally included NDVI, terrain slope, and soil sand and clay content as candidate predictors.

### Frequentialist approach

We begin with a conventional Resource Selection Function fitted by maximum likelihood. As described in the previous chapters, this requires contrasting observed relocations with randomly sampled available locations drawn from each individual's availability domain.

First, we load the telemetry data

```python
from hsa.movement.geometry import prepare_trajectory_data
df = pd.read_csv("data/relocations/pango-large-subset.csv")
reloc = prepare_trajectory_data(df, geometry_col="geometry", source_crs = "EPSG:32733", target_crs = "EPSG:32733")
```

and the environmental predictor stack:
```python
from hsa.compute import open_raster_stack_zarr
from hsa.compute import suggest_xy_chunks
import xarray as xr
import rioxarray 

env = open_raster_stack_zarr("pangolin_predictor_stack.zarr")
env = env.chunk(suggest_xy_chunks(env, target_chunk_mb=256))
env = env.rio.write_crs("EPSG:32733")
```

Pseudoabsence locations are generated from the individual-specific availability domains before extracting environmental conditions for both used and available points:

```python
from hsa.sampling import get_availability_domain, sample_available_points, sample_raster_stack
domains = get_availability_domain(reloc, id_col="Individual_ID")
sampling = sample_available_points(domains, used = reloc, n_per_used = 50, id_col = "Individual_ID")
sampled = sample_raster_stack(sampling, env, id_cols="Individual_ID")
```

Subsequently, we can iteratively fit models and check coefficients as well as cv-performance:

```python
from hsa.features import FeatureSpec
from hsa.rsf import fit_rsf, predict_rsf_surface

specs = FeatureSpec(linear = ["ndvi_30m"])
model, scaler, spec, meta = fit_rsf(sampled, specs)
rsf = predict_rsf_surface(env, model, scaler, spec, meta)
rsf["exp"] = np.exp(rsf)
```

During model construction we observe that edge-related variables consistently improve predictive performance, whereas several additional environmental predictors contribute comparatively little:

![Progressive Construction](figures-for-doc/progressive_construction.png "Progessive Model Construction")

Cross-validation suggests that the model performs well at the population level. However, examining validation statistics separately for each individual reveals an intriguing pattern.
![Boyce Curves](figures-for-doc/boyce_curves.png "Confusing Boyce Curves")

Although the average Boyce Index indicates satisfactory predictive performance, several individuals exhibit substantial deviations from the population trend. Some are predicted remarkably well, whereas others display weak or even contradictory selection patterns. This observation raises an important biological question: are these merely noisy individuals, or do different pangolins genuinely respond differently to their environment?

A classical RSF cannot distinguish between these possibilities because it assumes a single regression coefficient for every individual. We therefore turn to a hierarchical Bayesian formulation.
### Bayesian approach

Hierarchical Bayesian models provide a natural extension of the classical Resource Selection Function by explicitly recognising that individuals need not respond identically to the same environmental conditions. Rather than estimating a single coefficient for each predictor, we estimate a population-level distribution from which individual-specific coefficients are drawn.

Mathematically, the linear predictor becomes

$$
\eta_i
=
\alpha_{j[i]}
+
\sum_{k=1}^{K}
\beta_{k,j[i]} x_{ik},
$$

where observation $i$ belongs to individual $j$.

Each individual regression coefficient is assumed to arise from a population-level distribution,

$$
\beta_{k,j}
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(\mu_k,\sigma_k\right),
$$

where $\mu_k$ represents the average effect of predictor $k$ across the population, and $\sigma_k$ quantifies the extent of individual variation.

Similarly, the individual intercepts are modelled as

$$
\alpha_j
\sim
\mathcal{N}\!\left(\mu_\alpha,\sigma_\alpha\right).
$$

This formulation allows information to be shared across individuals through partial pooling, while still permitting genuine behavioural differences to emerge.

To reduce overfitting, we additionally employ a hierarchical regularized horseshoe prior, which automatically shrinks unsupported predictors towards zero while allowing important environmental variables to retain substantial effect sizes.

Fitting the model requires only replacing the estimation routine.

The resulting posterior distributions immediately reveal that the apparent lack of fit in the classical model was not simply statistical noise. Instead, individuals differ markedly in the strength—and occasionally even the direction—of habitat selection.

![Posterior NDVI](figures-for-doc/posterior_individual_slopes_ndvi.png "Posterior Slopes")


## Seasonally-Variant RSF (Lion)

### Challenge

Large African carnivores frequently exhibit strong associations with river systems. In semi-arid environments, rivers function as linear oases, supporting comparatively high primary productivity and consequently elevated prey densities. Yet the strength of this association is unlikely to remain constant throughout the year. Seasonal rainfall alters vegetation structure, prey distributions, and water availability, while prolonged drought may fundamentally reshape habitat selection.

We therefore ask how lion selection for riverine habitat changes throughout the annual cycle, and whether this seasonal trajectory differs between contrasting environmental conditions.

### Solution
Using telemetry data from 21 lions, we fitted a Resource Selection Function.

![Seasonal RSF](figures-for-doc/rsf_surface_lions.png "Seasonal RSF")

To quantify these dynamics formally, we model the probability that relocation $j$ is used as

$$
y_j
\sim
\mathrm{Binomial}(n_j,p_j),
$$

with

$$
\mathrm{logit}(p_j)
=
\alpha_i
+
\beta_{i,s[j]}x^{\mathrm{river}}_j
+
\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\top}\mathbf{x}_j,
$$

where $x^{\mathrm{river}}_j$ denotes the standardized river predictor, $\mathbf{x}_j$ contains the remaining environmental covariates, observation $j$ belongs to individual $i$, and occurs during season $s[j]$.

Rather than estimating an independent river-selection coefficient for every season, we decompose the effect hierarchically as

$$
\beta_{i,s}
=
\mu_\beta
+
\gamma_{g[i]}
+
\delta_s
+
\kappa_{g[i],s}
+
b_i,
$$

where

- $\mu_\beta$ is the overall population mean,
- $\gamma_g$ is the effect of group $g$,
- $\delta_s$ represents the shared seasonal trajectory,
- $\kappa_{g,s}$ captures group-specific seasonal deviations, and
- $b_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_{\mathrm{individual}})$ represents persistent individual variation.

Consequently, the expected seasonal trajectory for each group becomes

$$
\beta_{g,s}
=
\mu_\beta
+
\gamma_g
+
\delta_s
+
\kappa_{g,s},
$$

while each individual follows

$$
\beta_{i,s}
=
\beta_{g[i],s}
+
b_i.
$$

The posterior trajectories clearly demonstrate that river selection is not static, but fluctuates predictably throughout the annual cycle. Moreover, the two ecological groups exhibit distinct seasonal responses, illustrating how hierarchical Bayesian models can simultaneously estimate population-level temporal trends while retaining persistent individual differences.

## Dynamic SSF (Vultures)

### 1. Question

Bearded vultures _(Gypaetus barbatus)_ move through a landscape in which the energetic cost of flight changes from hour to hour. The relevant landscape thus cannot be fully described in environmental space alone, but must be integrated through time to reveal an energy landscape dynamically generated by interactions between atmosphere and terrain. Soaring allows large birds to replace metabolically costly flapping with energy extracted from rising air, and vultures can sustain soaring–gliding flight at energetic costs close to resting levels under favourable conditions (Duriez et al., 2014). The central question of this case study is therefore:

> **How do bearded vultures select locations and modify their movement in response to dynamically varying thermal and orographic uplift conditions?**


Two mechanisms dominate inland soaring. Thermal soaring exploits buoyant ascent generated by surface heating; birds typically climb by circling within rising air and then convert altitude into horizontal displacement during glides. Slope soaring exploits mechanically generated uplift where horizontal wind is forced upward by topography. The relative importance of these modes changes with weather, topography and the spatial scale at which movement is observed (Bohrer et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2017; Harel et al., 2016; Scacco et al., 2019).

![Soaring Ecology of Bearded vultures](<figures-for-doc/vultures/soaring-figure.png>)

The statistical challenge is that the same conditions that affect *where* a bird moves can also affect *how* it moves. A step-selection analysis therefore becomes most informative when the habitat-selection and movement processes are estimated jointly.

---

## 2. Atmospheric forcing as mathematical predictors

### 2.1 Orographic uplift potential

Let the horizontal wind vector be

$$
\mathbf{u}=(u,v),
$$

where $u$ is the eastward wind component and $v$ the northward component. Let terrain aspect be represented by the unit components

$$
E=\sin A, \qquad N=\cos A,
$$

where $A$ is the **downslope** aspect measured clockwise from north. The unit vector toward steepest ascent is therefore

$$
\mathbf{s}_{\uparrow}=(-E,-N).
$$

The horizontal wind component directed upslope is

$$
U_{\uparrow}
=
\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{s}_{\uparrow}
=
-uE-vN.
$$

If the local terrain slope is $\theta$, the terrain gradient in the steepest-slope direction is $\tan\theta$. We therefore use the kinematic proxy

$$
\boxed{
 w_{\mathrm{oro}}
 =
 (-uE-vN)\tan\theta
}
$$

with units of $m s^{-1}$ when $u$ and $v$ are in $m s^{-1}$. Positive values indicate wind directed upslope and therefore potential terrain-forced ascent; negative values indicate downslope flow. This is closely related to the terrain–wind formulations of Brandes & Ombalski (2004) and Bohrer et al. (2012), but is expressed directly as horizontal flow across the local terrain gradient.

![Orographic wind potential](figures-for-doc//vultures/orographic-upwind_conditions.png)

*Orographic uplift potential across five hourly wind fields. The alternating positive and negative patches arise because a common wind field encounters opposing slope orientations. The spatial pattern is consequently more terrain-structured and less strongly diurnal than the thermal field.*

### 2.2 Thermal forcing

ERA5-Land is an hourly land-surface reanalysis at approximately 9 km native resolution (Muñoz-Sabater et al., 2021). It provides accumulated surface sensible heat flux, `sshf`. We first recover the hourly increment and convert the sign convention to upward-positive flux:

$$
\boxed{
H_t
=
-\frac{\mathrm{SSHF}_t-\mathrm{SSHF}_{t-1}}{3600}
}
$$

where $H_t$ is sensible heat flux upward in $W m^{-2}$. In the code below, accumulation resets are handled explicitly before differencing.

Positive $H$ means that sensible heat is transferred from the surface to the atmosphere. It is therefore a mechanistic proxy for the surface forcing that can produce buoyant convection.



![Thermal potential](figures-for-doc//vultures/thermal_conditions.png)

*Hourly sensible heat flux shows a pronounced diurnal development. Unlike the ridge-scale structure of the orographic proxy, thermal forcing is spatially smoother because its atmospheric component is inherited from the coarser ERA5-Land field.*

---

## 3. From resource selection to integrated step selection

A resource-selection function asks whether used locations differ from a set of locations considered available. For standardized predictors $\mathbf{x}$, a conventional exponential RSF writes

$$
w(\mathbf{x})=\exp(\boldsymbol\beta^\top\mathbf{x}).
$$

The difficulty is the definition of availability. An SSF makes availability local and conditional on movement: each observed step is compared with alternative steps beginning at the same location (Fortin et al., 2005; Thurfjell et al., 2014).

![Step Selection](figures-for-doc//vultures/step-selection-explanation.png)

For stratum $s$, let $j=0,\ldots,J-1$ index the observed endpoint and its alternatives. In this case study we draw $20$ available alternatives, so each retained stratum contains $J=21$ choices. The conditional-choice probability is

$$
\boxed{
P(Y_s=j)
=
\frac{\exp(\eta_{sj})}
{\sum_{k=0}^{J-1}\exp(\eta_{sk})}
}
$$

with one observed choice per stratum.

### 3.1 Movement-informed availability

Available steps are not drawn uniformly in space. For individual $i$, hrHSA first fits an individual movement proposal from observed step lengths and turning angles. Denote the resulting proposal density by

$$
q_i(L,\theta).
$$

Candidate steps are then sampled from this movement-conditioned proposal, subject to the temporal interval, speed limit and spatial domain. This concentrates computational effort on biologically plausible alternatives.

However, because the alternatives were sampled non-uniformly, the proposal density must be accounted for in the likelihood. If a target integral is approximated using draws from $q$, importance sampling contributes a factor $1/q$. On the log scale this becomes

$$
\boxed{o_{sj}=-\log q_{sj}}.
$$

The proposal-corrected utility is therefore

$$
\boxed{
\eta_{sj}
=
\boldsymbol\beta^\top\mathbf{x}_{sj}
-
\log q_{sj}
}
$$

for an endpoint-only model. The offset is fixed with coefficient exactly one; it is not an estimated ecological effect. hrHSA centers it within strata because any constant shared by all alternatives cancels from the conditional softmax.

### 3.2 The iSSF movement basis

Integrated step-selection analysis estimates habitat selection and movement jointly (Avgar et al., 2016). hrHSA uses the default movement basis

$$
\boxed{
\mathbf{m}_{sj}
=
\left(
L_{sj},
\log L_{sj},
\cos\theta_{sj}
\right)
}
$$

where $L$ is net displacement in kilometres and $\theta$ is the turning angle relative to the incoming heading.

The length terms imply a Gamma-like kernel

$$
f(L)
\propto
L^{\gamma_{\log L}}
\exp(\gamma_LL),
$$

so, when $1+\gamma_{\log L}>0$ and $\gamma_L<0$,

$$
k=1+\gamma_{\log L},
\qquad
\lambda=-\gamma_L,
\qquad
E[L]=\frac{k}{\lambda}.
$$

The turning term implies a von-Mises-like kernel

$$
f(\theta)
\propto
\exp\{\kappa\cos\theta\},
\qquad
\kappa=\gamma_{\cos\theta}.
$$

Thus $\kappa>0$ favours directional persistence around $0^\circ$, whereas $\kappa<0$ places relatively more mass toward large turning angles. At an hourly GPS interval this describes net displacement between fixes.

## 4. Data preparation

We use five tagged bearded vultures and retain approximately hourly relocations. All geometry used for step construction is projected to EPSG:2062 so that distances and bearings are computed in metric coordinates.

```python

        "BG1036_Huesitos",
        "BG1049_Stelvio 50",
        "BG1053_Bwindi",
        "BG1057_Curro",
    ],
)

reloc = prepare_trajectory_data(
    birds,
    id_col=ID_COL,
    timestamp_col="timestamp",
    lon_col="location-long",
    lat_col="location-lat",
    source_crs="EPSG:4326",
    target_crs="EPSG:2062",
)

reloc = reloc[
    [ID_COL, TIME_COL, "geometry"]
].copy()

env = xr.open_zarr(
    "data/raster/vultures_terrain-SPAIN-2062.zarr",
    decode_coords="all",
)
```

ERA5-Land supplies the time-varying atmospheric forcing. Accumulated fluxes are converted to hourly rates before being sampled at step times.

```python
era5 = xr.open_dataset(
    "https://api.earthdatahub.destine.eu/era5/era5-land-v0.zarr",
    storage_options={
        "client_kwargs": {"trust_env": True}
    },
    chunks={},
    engine="zarr",
)


def era5_land_hourly_increment(
    da,
    *,

):
    previous = da.shift({time_name: 1})
    increment = da - previous
    hour = da[time_name].dt.hour
    return xr.where(hour == 1, da, increment)


H = (

    / 3600.0
).rename("sensible_heat_flux_upward")

met = xr.Dataset(
    {
        "sensible_heat_flux_upward": H,
        "skin_temperature": era5["skt"],
        "air_temperature_2m": era5["t2m"],
        "dewpoint_temperature_2m": era5["d2m"],
        "wind_u_10m": era5["u10"],
        "wind_v_10m": era5["v10"],
    }
)

met["surface_air_temperature_excess"] = (
    met["skin_temperature"]
    - met["air_temperature_2m"]
)

met["dewpoint_depression"] = (
    met["air_temperature_2m"]
    - met["dewpoint_temperature_2m"]
)

met["wind_speed_10m"] = np.hypot(
    met["wind_u_10m"],
    met["wind_v_10m"],
)
```

## 5. Constructing the choice sets

```python
issf = FrequentistISSF(
    reloc,
    id_col=ID_COL,
    timestamp_col=TIME_COL,
    expected_interval_min=60,
    tolerance_min=10,
)

issf.sample(
    n_available=N_AVAILABLE,
    seed=SEED,
    domain=env,
    observed_outside="exclude",
)
```

The current exploratory dataset yields complete strata with one observed and 20 available alternatives. The crucial point is that the alternatives are generated from individual-specific movement kernels and not from an arbitrary spatial buffer.

```python
movement_kernels = issf.movement_["summary"]
movement_kernels.head()
```

The fitted proposal determines $q_i(L,\theta)$, while the later iSSF asks whether the observed movement kernel differs systematically with environmental conditions.

---

## 6. Endpoint, start and directional predictors

The three predictor roles correspond to three different mathematical objects.

| Role | Notation | Varies within stratum? | Example | Interpretation |
|---|---:|:---:|---|---|
| Endpoint | $x_{sj}$ | Yes | elevation, slope, heat, endpoint orographic uplift | Does the bird choose this endpoint over the alternatives? |
| Start condition | $z_s$ | No | heat at departure, VRM at departure, orographic uplift at departure | Does the departure environment change the movement kernel? |
| Directional | $d_{sj}$ | Yes | wind support projected onto candidate bearing | Does movement become more likely in directions supported by the vector field? |

A start-condition main effect cannot be estimated in a conditional choice model because it is identical for every candidate in the stratum:

$$
\frac{\exp(c_s+\eta_{sj})}
{\sum_k\exp(c_s+\eta_{sk})}
=
\frac{\exp(\eta_{sj})}
{\sum_k\exp(\eta_{sk})}.
$$

Therefore a start condition enters through interactions with movement terms. For example,

$$
\gamma_L(z_s)
=
\gamma_L+\delta_Lz_s,
$$

so that the step-length distribution changes with the environment at departure.

A directional predictor is different. For candidate bearing $\phi_{sj}$, start-point wind support is

$$
\boxed{
D_{sj}
=u_s\sin\phi_{sj}+v_s\cos\phi_{sj}
}
$$

where $u_s$ and $v_s$ are the eastward and northward wind components at the common step start. $D_{sj}>0$ is tailwind support and $D_{sj}<0$ is headwind. Although the wind vector is shared within the stratum, its projection changes with candidate direction; the predictor therefore has an identifiable main effect and can also modify the movement kernel.

A convenient annotation workflow is:

```python
issf.annotate_static(
    env,
    endpoint=[
        "elevation",
        "slope",
        "eastness",
        "northness",
        "vrm_2070m",
        "tpi_2070m",
    ],
    start=[
        "elevation",
        "slope",
        "eastness",
        "northness",
        "vrm_2070m",
        "tpi_2070m",
    ],
)

issf.annotate_dynamic(
    met,
    endpoint={
        "sensible_heat_flux_upward": "heat",
    },
    start={
        "sensible_heat_flux_upward": "heat_start",
    },
    method="linear",
)

issf.annotate_vector(
    met,
    u="wind_u_10m",
    v="wind_v_10m",
    prefix="wind",
    at=("endpoint", "start"),
    support=True,
    method="linear",
)
```

The orographic proxies can then be derived at both endpoint and start:

```python
def orographic_uplift(
    slope_deg,
    eastness,
    northness,
    u,
    v,
):
    slope_rad = np.deg2rad(
        np.asarray(slope_deg, dtype=float)
    )

    wind_upslope = (
        -np.asarray(u, dtype=float)
        * np.asarray(eastness, dtype=float)
        -np.asarray(v, dtype=float)
        * np.asarray(northness, dtype=float)
    )

    return wind_upslope * np.tan(slope_rad)


choices = issf.choices.copy()

choices["orographic_uplift"] = orographic_uplift(
    choices["slope"],
    choices["eastness"],
    choices["northness"],
    choices["wind_u"],
    choices["wind_v"],
)

choices["orographic_uplift_start"] = orographic_uplift(
    choices["slope_start"],
    choices["eastness_start"],
    choices["northness_start"],
    choices["wind_u_start"],
    choices["wind_v_start"],
)

issf.choices_ = choices
```

---

# 7. A sequence of increasingly mechanistic models

Rather than fitting the most complex model immediately, we add one statistical idea at a time. This makes every change in the coefficients interpretable.

## 7.1 Model 1 — naive endpoint SSF

We begin with a conventional conditional-choice model and deliberately ignore the non-uniform proposal density:

$$
\eta^{(1)}_{sj}
=
\boldsymbol\beta^\top\mathbf{x}_{sj}.
$$

```python
selection = [
    "elevation",
    "slope",
    "vrm_2070m",
    "tpi_2070m",
    "heat",
    "orographic_uplift",
]

issf.set_model(
    selection=selection,
    movement=False,
    proposal_correction=False,
)

design_naive = issf.prepare_design()

fit_naive = issf.fit(
    scaling=design_naive.scaling,
    engine="fast",
    method="lbfgs",
    maxiter=1000,
)
```

All endpoint predictors are standardized before fitting,

$$
x_z=\frac{x-\mu_x}{\sigma_x}.
$$

For a standardized contrast $\Delta x$, the relative-selection ratio is

$$
\boxed{
RSS(\Delta x)=\exp(\beta\Delta x)
}.
$$

For $\Delta x=1$, the naive fit gives:

| Predictor | $\hat\beta$ | 95% CI | $e^{\beta}$ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Elevation | 0.851 | 0.830–0.872 | 2.34 |
| Slope | 0.681 | 0.673–0.689 | 1.98 |
| VRM (2070 m) | 0.243 | 0.233–0.252 | 1.27 |
| TPI (2070 m) | 0.074 | 0.066–0.081 | 1.08 |
| Sensible heat flux | 0.318 | 0.180–0.457 | 1.37 |
| Orographic uplift | 0.007 | 0.001–0.013 | 1.007 |

The dominant pattern is selection for high and steep terrain, with additional positive effects of ruggedness and heat. The endpoint orographic coefficient is close to zero in magnitude. This should not be read as evidence that orographic soaring is unimportant: a localized uplift can modify movement during the step without necessarily making the *endpoint* itself strongly preferred.

Because the choice likelihood is driven by within-stratum contrasts, $e^\beta$ should not automatically be interpreted as the effect of a typical choice. For a more realistic contrast $\Delta x$, use $\exp(\beta\Delta x)$.

## 7.2 Model 2 — proposal-corrected endpoint SSF

We now fit exactly the same ecological model but account for the density from which alternatives were sampled:

$$
\eta^{(2)}_{sj}
=
\boldsymbol\beta^\top\mathbf{x}_{sj}
-
\log q_{sj}.
$$

```python
issf.set_model(
    selection=selection,
    movement=False,
    proposal_correction=True,
)

design_corrected = issf.prepare_design(
    scaling=design_naive.scaling,
)

fit_corrected = issf.fit(
    scaling=design_naive.scaling,
    engine="fast",
    method="lbfgs",
    maxiter=1000,
)
```

| Predictor | $\hat\beta$ | 95% CI | $e^{\beta}$ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Elevation | 1.721 | 1.704–1.738 | 5.59 |
| Slope | 1.243 | 1.233–1.252 | 3.47 |
| VRM (2070 m) | 0.441 | 0.431–0.450 | 1.55 |
| TPI (2070 m) | 0.048 | 0.040–0.056 | 1.05 |
| Sensible heat flux | 0.491 | 0.407–0.575 | 1.63 |
| Orographic uplift | 0.008 | 0.002–0.015 | 1.008 |

The correction markedly strengthens the elevation, slope, ruggedness and heat coefficients. Mathematically this means that the proposal distribution itself made some high-value terrain relatively easy to sample. Once each candidate is reweighted by $1/q$, stronger selection is required to explain why the observed endpoints occur there.

![Proposal correction](figures-for-doc//vultures/proposal_correction.png)

*The proposal correction is an importance-sampling correction, not an additional ecological covariate. Its purpose is to separate the choice process from the non-uniform mechanism used to generate alternatives.*

## 7.3 Model 3 — baseline iSSF

We next add the movement basis while retaining the proposal correction:

$$
\boxed{
\eta^{(3)}_{sj}
=
\boldsymbol\beta^\top\mathbf{x}_{sj}
+
\gamma_L L_{sj}
+
\gamma_{\log L}\log L_{sj}
+
\kappa\cos\theta_{sj}
-
\log q_{sj}
}
$$

```python
issf.set_model(
    selection=selection,
    movement="default",
    proposal_correction=True,
)

design_movement = issf.prepare_design(
    scaling=design_naive.scaling,
)

fit_movement = issf.fit(
    scaling=design_naive.scaling,
    engine="fast",
    method="lbfgs",
    maxiter=1000,
)
```

The fitted baseline movement terms are

$$
\gamma_L=-0.09793,
\qquad
\gamma_{\log L}=-0.44665,
\qquad
\kappa=-0.18537.
$$

Ignoring truncation for interpretation, the corresponding Gamma-like length kernel has

$$
k=1-0.44665=0.55335,
$$

$$
\lambda=0.09793\ \mathrm{km}^{-1},
$$

and therefore

$$
E[L]\approx\frac{0.55335}{0.09793}=5.65\ \mathrm{km}.
$$

The negative turning coefficient means that the fitted hourly net-displacement kernel places relatively more mass at large turning angles than at $0^\circ$. This does not imply repeated literal reversals in flight: a vulture may circle in uplift and then leave in a new direction while the GPS data record only the net hourly displacement.

![Baseline step distribution](figures-for-doc//vultures/baseline_step_distribution.png)

![Baseline angle distribution](figures-for-doc//vultures/baseline_angle_distribution.png)

After movement terms enter, the endpoint coefficients become smaller than in the corrected endpoint-only model (for example elevation decreases from 1.721 to 0.936 and slope from 1.243 to 0.758). This is the central motivation for iSSF: part of what an endpoint-only model attributes to habitat is explained by the geometry of movement itself.

## 7.4 Model 4 — environment-dependent movement

The final frequentist model allows conditions at departure to alter the movement kernel. Let

$$
\mathbf{m}_{sj}
=
(L_{sj},\log L_{sj},\cos\theta_{sj})^\top
$$

and let $z_{sr}$ denote a start condition such as heat or ruggedness. The start-conditioned movement contribution is

$$
\sum_r z_{sr}\,\boldsymbol\delta_r^\top\mathbf{m}_{sj}.
$$

For directional wind support $D_{sj}$, which varies among candidate bearings, we additionally estimate a main directional effect and movement interactions. The complete utility can be written compactly as

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\eta_{sj}
={}&
\boldsymbol\beta^\top\mathbf{x}_{sj}
+
\boldsymbol\gamma^\top\mathbf{m}_{sj}
+
\sum_r z_{sr}\boldsymbol\delta_r^\top\mathbf{m}_{sj}\\
&+
\alpha D_{sj}
+
D_{sj}\boldsymbol\xi^\top\mathbf{m}_{sj}
-
\log q_{sj}.
\end{aligned}
}
$$

This single model now answers three distinct questions: where the bird chooses to end a step ($\boldsymbol\beta$), how it moves under average conditions ($\boldsymbol\gamma$), and how the current atmosphere or terrain changes that movement ($\boldsymbol\delta_r$ and $\boldsymbol\xi$).

```python
issf.set_model(
    selection=[
        "elevation",
        "slope",
        "orographic_uplift",
    ],

    movement="default",

    modifiers={
        "elevation_start": [
            "step_length",
            "turning",
        ],
        "vrm_2070m_start": [
            "step_length",
            "turning",
        ],
        "tpi_2070m_start": [
            "step_length",
            "turning",
        ],
        "heat_start": [
            "step_length",
            "turning",
        ],
        "orographic_uplift_start": [
            "step_length",
            "turning",
        ],
        "wind_start_support": [
            "step_length",
            "turning",
        ],
    },

    proposal_correction=True,
)

fit_full = issf.fit(
    engine="fast",
    method="lbfgs",
    maxiter=1500,
)
```

The distinction between endpoint and start-point orographic uplift is deliberate. `orographic_uplift` asks whether the chosen endpoint itself has greater uplift potential. `orographic_uplift_start` asks whether uplift available at departure changes subsequent step length or turning behaviour.

### Movement responses are derived quantities

For a start condition $z$, the effective length coefficients are

$$
\gamma_L(z)=\gamma_L+\delta_Lz,
$$

$$
\gamma_{\log L}(z)=\gamma_{\log L}+\delta_{\log L}z,
$$

so that

$$
E[L\mid z]
=
\frac{1+\gamma_{\log L}(z)}{-\gamma_L(z)}.
$$

This is why the ecological response should be evaluated from the implied movement distribution or expected displacement, rather than by interpreting either interaction coefficient in isolation. More importantly, these derived responses provide a direct link between environmental conditions and the movement strategy available to the animal.

```python
fit_full.plot_movement_response(
    "vrm_2070m_start",
)
```
![VRM movement response](figures-for-doc//vultures/vrm_2070m_movement_response.png)

Increasing terrain ruggedness at the beginning of a step is associated with a pronounced reduction in expected displacement. Rather than simply indicating that rugged terrain impedes movement, this response may reflect a change in behavioural state. For bearded vultures, rugged mountain terrain contains cliffs, ridges, and other features associated with favourable soaring and foraging habitat. Shorter displacement under high VRM may therefore indicate localized movement within favourable habitat, whereas movement through less rugged terrain is characterized by longer, more transitory steps. In this interpretation, ruggedness modulates not only where vultures occur, but also how intensively they move through the landscape.

```python
fit_full.plot_movement_response(
    "heat_start",
)
```
![Heat movement response](figures-for-doc//vultures/heat_movement_response.png)
Thermal conditions show the opposite response. Increasing thermal support strongly increases expected displacement, consistent with the energetic mechanism of thermal soaring: rising air allows vultures to gain altitude with little expenditure of flapping flight and subsequently convert this altitude into long glides. Strong thermal conditions therefore expand the distance that can be covered within an hourly movement step. The model consequently links atmospheric energy availability directly to landscape permeability: under strong thermal uplift, distant parts of the landscape become energetically more accessible.

For turning,

$$
\kappa(z)
=
\kappa_0+\delta_\theta z,
$$

and

$$
f(\theta\mid z)
\propto
\exp\{\kappa(z)\cos\theta\}.
$$

```python
fit_full.plot_turning_angle_distribution(
    "wind_start_support",
    levels=(-1, 0, 1),
)
```
![alt text](figures-for-doc//vultures/turning-angle_uplift.png)

Thus $\delta_\theta>0$ means that increasing the start condition shifts the kernel toward greater directional persistence. In the exploratory orographic example, stronger uplift at departure makes $\kappa$ less negative: the hourly path remains broad, but the relative tendency toward straight continuation increases. Ecologically, this response differs from the effect of thermal uplift. Whereas thermals primarily facilitate long-distance displacement, orographic uplift is spatially constrained by topography: horizontal winds are deflected upward along slopes and ridgelines. Increased directional persistence under stronger orographic support is therefore consistent with ridge-following flight, in which vultures exploit a relatively linear corridor of rising air. Orographic conditions may thus influence the geometry of movement—promoting sustained directional travel along terrain features—even when their effect on absolute displacement is comparatively small.

Directional wind support can be inspected in the same way:

```python
fit_full.plot_movement_response(
    "wind_start_support",
)

fit_full.plot_turning_angle_distribution(
    "wind_start_support",
    levels=(-1, 0, 1),
)
```

Here $-1$ SD represents stronger headwind support and $+1$ SD stronger tailwind support. Because wind support itself depends on candidate bearing, its turning interaction should be interpreted as a directional movement response rather than as an ordinary scalar habitat effect.

## 8. Interactions among environmental movement drivers

Environmental conditions rarely act on movement in isolation. In soaring birds in particular, terrain determines where uplift can form, while atmospheric conditions determine when that energetic resource becomes available and how effectively it can be exploited. The movement kernel therefore provides a natural way to ask how several environmental drivers jointly alter the movement opportunities available to an animal.

Two start conditions can be visualized together even when the fitted model contains only additive modifier terms. For example, the implied displacement response to thermal uplift can be evaluated under low, average, and high terrain ruggedness:

```python
fit_full.plot_movement_response(
    "vrm_2070m_start",
    moderator="heat_start",
    moderator_levels=(-1, 0, 1),
)
```
![Interaction between VRM and heat](figures-for-doc//vultures/interaction-vrm-heat.png)

The resulting curves reveal a particularly intuitive ecological pattern. Stronger thermal conditions increase expected displacement across all levels of terrain ruggedness, consistent with thermal soaring increasing the distance that can be travelled efficiently within an hourly step. Yet the magnitude of this response depends strongly on the landscape context. In relatively smooth terrain ((-1) SD VRM), strong thermal conditions imply very long displacements, whereas the same increase in thermal support produces a much smaller realized displacement in highly rugged terrain ((+1) SD VRM).

This suggests two complementary dimensions of the movement landscape. Thermal uplift controls movement capacity, increasing the potential for long-distance soaring, whereas terrain ruggedness modulates how that capacity is expressed in space. Low-ruggedness landscapes combined with strong thermals are associated with long, potentially transitory movements; highly rugged landscapes remain associated with shorter movements even when atmospheric conditions would otherwise permit efficient long-distance flight. For bearded vultures, the latter pattern is consistent with localized movement within mountainous habitat containing cliffs, ridges, feeding areas, or other resources, rather than simply with terrain imposing a mechanical constraint on flight.

Importantly, this figure does not by itself demonstrate a statistical heat × VRM interaction. The fitted modifiers remain additive on the coefficient scale. Instead, their joint ecological effect becomes nonlinear when those coefficients are transformed into the parameters of the Gamma step-length distribution. If

$$
\gamma_L+\delta_{L,1}z_1+\delta_{L,2}z_2
$$

and

$$
\gamma_{\log L}
+\delta_{\log L,1}z_1
+\delta_{\log L,2}z_2,
$$

then

$$
\frac{
1+\gamma_{\log L}(z_1,z_2)
}{
-\gamma_L(z_1,z_2)
}.
$$

Consequently, additive effects in coefficient space need not translate into parallel responses in movement space. The widening separation among the curves at high thermal support is therefore a property of the derived movement kernel, rather than evidence for an unmodelled statistical interaction.

More generally, these joint response surfaces provide an ecological interpretation of the fitted iSSF as a dynamic energy landscape. Movement opportunities arise from combinations of relatively persistent landscape structure and rapidly changing atmospheric conditions: terrain structures where soaring opportunities occur, while atmospheric conditions determine when those opportunities permit long-distance or directional movement.

# 9. From pooled inference to individual variation

The frequentist models above estimate one coefficient vector shared by all five birds. Such a population-level model asks whether environmental conditions systematically modify movement, but it cannot determine whether all individuals respond to those conditions in the same way. This distinction is biologically important: individuals may experience the same energetic landscape while differing in how strongly they exploit it.

The hierarchical Bayesian model replaces a single coefficient $\beta_p$ by individual-specific coefficients

$$
\boxed{
\beta_{ip}
=
\mu_p
+
\sigma_p z_{ip},
\qquad
z_{ip}\sim\mathcal N(0,1)
}
$$

for individual $i$ and model term $p$. Here $\mu_p$ is the population-level effect and $\sigma_p$ quantifies between-individual heterogeneity. Partial pooling means that poorly informed individual estimates shrink toward $\mu_p$, whereas individuals with substantial information can remain distinct.

The important inferential target is not simply whether $\beta_{ip}$ differs among birds. For movement terms, we transform each individual's posterior into the implied step-length and turning distributions. For example, individual-specific orographic persistence is

$$
\kappa_i(z)
=
\beta_{i,\cos\theta}
+
\beta_{i,\mathrm{oro}\times\cos\theta}z.
$$

A positive population interaction with a small $\sigma_p$ would indicate a shared response across vultures. A large $\sigma_p$ would indicate that individuals differ in how strongly they exploit the same uplift conditions.

```python
bayes = issf.to_bayesian(
    model_kwargs={
        "mu_sigma": 1.0,
        "heterogeneity_sigma": 0.35,
    }
)

# A pilot keeps all individuals but limits the number of
# complete strata per bird while the model is being checked.
bayes_pilot = bayes.subset(
    n_strata_per_id=500,
    seed=42,
)

fit_bayes = bayes_pilot.fit(
    scaling=fit_full.design.scaling,
    sample_kwargs={
        "draws": 1000,
        "tune": 1000,
        "chains": 4,
        "target_accept": 0.95,
        "nuts_sampler": "blackjax",
    },
)
```

Posterior summaries separate population means, individual coefficients and heterogeneity:

```python
population = fit_bayes.coefficients()
individuals = fit_bayes.individual_coefficients()
heterogeneity = fit_bayes.heterogeneity()
```

Posterior summaries separate population means, individual coefficients and heterogeneity:

```python
fit_bayes.plot_forest(
    predictors=[
        heat_start
    ],

    include_population=True,
    include_individual=True,
    include_heterogeneity=True,

    ci_prob=0.95,
)
```

![Individual movement responses](figures-for-doc//vultures/individual_vrm_step_response.png)

*Individual curves show the same ecological question on a common scale: how much does expected net displacement change across the environmental gradient? The Bayesian hierarchy distinguishes genuine between-individual response variation from noise caused by unequal sample sizes.*

This consistency in sign is ecologically informative. It suggests that the tendency for movement to become shorter in more rugged terrain is not driven by a single individual, but represents a shared population-level movement response. At the same time, the substantial variation in effect magnitude indicates that this response is not identical among birds. Some individuals show a considerably stronger reduction in movement with increasing ruggedness than others.

as shared mechanism, heterogeneous sensitivity. All individuals appear to modify their movement in the same direction when encountering rugged terrain, but they differ in the strength of that behavioural adjustment. Such variation could arise from differences in age, experience, ranging strategy, local landscape familiarity, territory configuration, or individual specialization. These mechanisms are hypotheses rather than direct conclusions of the model, but the hierarchical framework makes their existence testable.

For movement coefficients, however, coefficient-space heterogeneity is only an intermediate result. Because step length is described by several jointly estimated terms, differences in a single interaction coefficient do not necessarily translate proportionally into differences in realized movement. The biologically useful quantity is again the derived movement response:

```python
for individual in reloc["individual-local-identifier"].unique():
    fit_bayes.plot_movement_response(
        "heat_start",
        individual=individual,
        ax=ax,
    )
```
![Individual responses to thermal uplift](figures-for-doc//vultures/individual_heat_movement_response.png)

Transforming posterior draws into movement space allows the ecological question to be stated directly: how far is this individual expected to move under a given environmental condition? The same approach can be used to compare complete response curves among individuals rather than comparing isolated regression coefficients.

This distinction becomes especially important when evaluating soaring strategies. Individuals may share a general tendency for thermals to increase displacement, for orographic uplift to increase directional persistence, and for rugged terrain to reduce displacement, while differing substantially in the magnitude of each response. The hierarchical model can therefore distinguish between environmental effects that constitute a common movement strategy of the population and those that reflect stronger individual specialization.

In this sense, individual variation adds another layer to the dynamic energy landscape. The physical landscape determines where energetic opportunities occur, atmospheric conditions determine when they become available, and individual behaviour determines how strongly those opportunities are exploited. The resulting movement landscape is therefore neither purely environmental nor purely individual: it emerges from the interaction between terrain, atmosphere, and the movement strategy of the animal.
