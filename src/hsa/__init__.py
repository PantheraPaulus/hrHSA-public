"""Habitat selection and movement modelling tools.

The package is organised around a reusable workflow:

1. prepare telemetry data,
2. define availability,
3. sample environmental predictors,
4. build RSF/SSF design matrices,
5. fit and validate models,
6. predict habitat-selection surfaces,
7. optionally simulate movement through those surfaces.
